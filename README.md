# plugin.program.plexusscraper

This is a Kodi Program addon to scrape acestream and sopcast urls from a web page. 
Currently up to 5 different web page urls to be scraped can be saved in the addon's 
settings page.  

It is also possible to save a raw acestream or sopcast link (instead of a web page 
url) in the settings page. These raw links can also be given an optional title.
This title will also appear in the created Plexus "history.txt" file.

The purpose of this addon is to generate a valid "history.txt" file to be used by 
the "Plexus" addon. This addon effectively  automates the generation of a Plexus 
"history.txt" file.
