# We will use Python Behave (https://behave.readthedocs.io)
#
# Behave (https://behave.readthedocs.io) is a Gherkin-based BDD tool for Python 
# programs. Similar BDD tools for Python are Lettuce (http://pythonhosted.org/lettuce) 
# and Freshen (https://github.com/rlisagor/freshen). I have also come across pytest-bdd
# (https://pytest-bdd.readthedocs.io), but have not tried it yet. Behave is apparently
# "...the most stable, best documented, and most feature-rich of the three" (from 
# eBook "BDD In Action" (2015).
#
# Installation:
# pip install behave
#
# To run one particular feature, specify the path to the feature file, e.g.:
#	behave tests/behave/extract_links.feature
#
# To run one particular scenario of a feature, add "@wip" above the scenario in
# the feature file, and then run:
#	behave tests/behave --tags="@wip"
#

# standard library. But pytest provides additional features, and it produces a
# much nicer output.
#
# Installation:
# pip install pytest pytest-mock
#
# pytest handy options:
#	-x			Stops at the first test failure.
#	-s			Turn off stdout capture; instead display during tests.
#	--lf			Re-run only tests that failed last time.
#	--ff			Run test that failed last time first.
#	-l			Display local variables in failed test.
#	--fixtures		List all fixtures available to test.
#	--setup-show		Display full output from fixtures.
#	--doctest-modules	Test the code in function/module docstrings.
#	--markers		List all markers (custom and built-in).
#	-m <marker>		Run only tests marked with this (e.g. smoke).
#	-x --pdb 		Starts the debugger at the first test failure.
#				(-x prevents pdb from looking at the next failure).
#				NOTE: To stop the pdb debugger at a line of code:
#					import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

	# contain a single testsuite result; so we need to split-up this file
	# into one xml file per testsuite.

	# If we ever need to, it's possible to run tests against both Python 2 and 
	# Python 3 versions using Tox. See https://tox.readthedocs.io
	# NOTE: webserver.py currently fails on Python 2. Due to changes in HTTPServer
	#       in Python 3, we need seperate versions of webserver.py for Python 2 and 
	#       Python 3. Creating these is not a problem using "2to3" - the problem is
