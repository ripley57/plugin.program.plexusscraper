# import the packages we are testing (in the "src/" directory), we can use
# "pip install -e ." to install a "<package-name>.egg-link" file under 
# our Python installation. Instead of installing copies of a package, this
# creates a link back to the files in this directory. This works because
# we have a "setup.py" file in this directory. The "-e" option also means
# we can make changes to the files and re-test without having to re-install.

# Options passed:
#	-x			Stops at the first test failure.
#	-s			Turn off stdout capture; instead display during tests.
#	--lf			Re-run only tests that failed last time.
#	--ff			Run test that failed last time first.
#	-l			Display local variables in failed test.
#	--fixtures		List all fixtures available to test.
#	--setup-show		Display full output from fixtures.
#	--doctest-modules	Test the code in function/module docstrings.
#	--markers		List all markers (custom and built-in).
#	-m <marker>		Run only tests marked with this (e.g. smoke).
#	-x --pdb 		Starts the debugger at the first test failure.
#				(-x prevents pdb from looking at the next failure).
