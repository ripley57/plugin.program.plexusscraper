Sample real-life Kodi addon settings.xml files from file:///storage/.kodi/userdata/addon_data/program.plexusscraper/settings.xml

The settings.xml file is updated by this addon by the following Kodi/XMBC call:
	xbmcaddon.Addon(id='program.plexusscraper').setSetting(setting_id,url_path)

See docs here https://codedocs.xyz/AlwinEsch/kodi/group__python__xbmcaddon.html
(This find was found here: https://kodi.wiki/index.php?title=Xbmcaddon_module)

When we first install our addon, we provide a starting settings.xml file, located
here with the addon's program files:
	/storage/.kodi/addons/plugin.program.plexusscraper/resources/
However, when the addon is used, the xml file is copied and replaced with a 'live' 
version located here:
	/storage/.kodi/userdata/addon_data/program.plexusscraper/

Summary:
	Kodi/xbmc writes to the settings.xml file. We must not!
	But we can use what ever code we like to read it. 
	We can either read the xml file directly, or we can use the Kodi/xbmc api:
